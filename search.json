    "text": "2.1 Real Manifolds\nIn the first chapter, basic definitions and notations of differential geometry are introduced. After the introduction of the Riemannian metric tensor, new structures emerge. However, students often find it difficult to understand tensor notations and calculations in local coordinates, which can be a barrier to further study. To overcome this, we start our discussion of tensors in the more familiar context of real vector spaces (which you should already be familiar with), and then extend this to the manifold case. However, this is the only case before we consider derivatives. The notation gets even messier after taking covariant derivatives.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Definitions\nIn this subsection, we will review basic facts of real manifolds, and fix our notations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition\n\n\n\nA topological space \\(M\\) is called a topological manifold if there exists an open covering \\(\\{U_{\\alpha}\\}_{\\alpha\\in \\Lambda}\\) and for each \\(\\alpha \\in \\Lambda\\) a homeomorphism \\(\\phi_{\\alpha}\\) from \\(U_{\\alpha}\\) to an open subset in \\(\\RR^n\\). We call the collection \\(\\{U_{\\alpha}, \\phi_{\\alpha}\\}_{\\alpha\\in \\Lambda}\\) an atlas on \\(M\\). An atlas on \\(M\\) is called of class \\(C^k\\) if the transition map \\[\n    \\phi_{\\alpha}\\circ\\phi_{\\beta}^{-1}: \\phi_{\\beta}(U_{\\alpha}\\cap U_{\\beta})\\to \\phi_{\\alpha}(U_{\\alpha}\\cap U_{\\beta})\n\\] are \\(C^k\\) maps whenever \\(U_{\\alpha}\\cap U_{\\beta}\\ne \\varnothing\\). A maximal \\(C^k\\) atlas on \\(M\\) is called a \\(C^k\\)-differential structure. \\(k=\\infty\\), we call \\(M\\) a smooth manifold.\n\n\nThroughout this note, we will only consider smooth manifolds. Given a smooth manifold \\(M^n\\), the ring of smooth functions on \\(M\\) is denoted by \\(C^{\\infty}(M)\\). We have the tangent bundle \\(TM\\) and cotangent bundle \\(T^*M\\). The space of smooth sections, i.e. vector fields, is denoted by \\(\\Gamma(TM)\\). They act on \\(C^{\\infty}(M)\\) as derivations. One can check directly that \\([X, Y]:=XY-YX\\) is also a derivation of \\(C^{\\infty}(M)\\). The bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity: \\[\n    [X, [Y, Z]]+[Y, [Z, X]]+[Z, [X, Y]]=0,\n\\] for \\(X, Y, Z\\in \\Gamma(TM)\\), hence \\((\\Gamma(TM), [,])\\) is an infinite dimensional Lie algebra. Similarly, the space of co-vector fields, i.e. one forms, is denoted by \\(\\Gamma(T^*M)\\).\n\n\n2.1.2 Local coordinates and local frame for real manifold\nLet \\(\\{U_{\\alpha}, \\phi_{\\alpha}\\}_{\\alpha\\in \\Lambda}\\) be an atlas of \\(M\\). For simplicity, we usually omit the subscript \\({\\alpha}\\) when we are working within a single coordinate chart. Therefore, the local coordinate functions are written as \\((x^1, x^2, \\cdots, x^n)\\) and the basis for \\(TM|_{U_{\\alpha}}\\) are written as: \\[\n    \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^2},\\cdots, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^n} \\right)=:(\\partial_1, \\partial_2, \\cdots, \\partial_n).\n\\] \\(\\{\\partial_1, \\partial_2, \\cdots, \\partial_n\\}\\) are called coordinate vector fields, they are defined within the local charts. Since the partial derivatives are interchangeable in \\(\\RR^n\\), we know \\[\n    [\\partial_i, \\partial_j]=0.\n\\] The coordinate co-vector fields (differential \\(1\\)-form), are: \\[\n    \\left(d x^1, d x^2,\\cdots, d x^n \\right),\\quad \\text{note that}\\ d x^i(\\partial_j)=\\delta^i_j.\n\\]\nThe set of coordinate vector fields is a special case of a local frame: \\[\n    \\{\\be_1, \\cdots, \\be_n\\},\n\\] is called a local frame on \\(U\\subset M^n\\), if at each point \\(p\\in U\\) \\[\n    \\{\\be_1(p), \\cdots, \\be_n(p)\\}\n\\] form a basis of \\(T_pM\\). In general \\([\\be_i, \\be_j]\\ne 0\\). We denote the set of dual one forms of \\(\\{\\be_1, \\cdots, \\be_n\\}\\) by \\[\n    \\{\\bomega^1, \\cdots, \\bomega^n\\}.\n\\] namely, they satisfy: \\[\n    \\bomega^i(\\be_j)=\\delta^i_j.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition (Kronecker Delta)\n\n\n\nThe Kronecker delta function \\(\\delta^i_j\\) is defined by \\[\n\\delta^i_j=\n\\begin{cases}\n1&\\quad \\text{if }\\ i=j\\\\\n0&\\quad \\text{if }\\ i\\ne j\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Einstein’s notation\nGiven a vector field \\(X\\in \\Gamma(TM)\\), at point \\(p\\in U_{\\alpha}\\) it can be written as a linear combination of the basis:\n\\[\n    X(p)=(\\be_1(p)\\cdots,\\be_n(p))\\begin{pmatrix}X^1(p)\\\\ \\vdots \\\\X^n(p)\\end{pmatrix}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\be_i(p)X^i(p).\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nNow we introduce Einstein’s notation for taking summation. Since tensors tend to have lots of super- and sub-scripts, and many summations over many indices. Keeping track of the summation with the usual ``\\(\\sum\\)’’ notation is time consuming and space consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningConvention\n\n\n\nWe will use following Einstein’s sum convention through the lectures.\n\nWhen an index appears twice in an expression, once as a superscript and once as a subscript, it signifies summation over the range of that index. This type of index is called dummy index, and renaming it is allowed.\nA summed index in an expression should appear only twice: once as a subscript and once as a superscript. Seeing it appear three times indicates an error.\nIn our lectures, the range of summation is typically assumed to be from 1 to the dimension of the manifold, unless otherwise specified by the context.\nIt takes time to get used to Einstein’s notation. But once you know how it works, it becomes as intuitive as breathing.\n\n\n\nWe’ll omit the point \\(p\\) if it is clear from the context, therefore Equation 2.1 can be written as \\[\n    X=\\be_{\\red \\alpha}X^{\\red \\alpha},\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nthe red index \\(\\red{\\alpha}\\) in Equation 2.2 is repeated as a superscript and a subscript, therefore we need to sum it from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\). Is it possible that we only sum from \\(1\\) to another number, say, \\([n/2]\\)? In general, the answer is no. This is because all reasonable quantities defined using local coordinates must be independent of the specific choice of coordinates.\nYou may have noticed that we write the coordinate'' orcomponents’’ of \\(X\\) to the right of the basis, this is because of the convention we take in Equation 2.1. Namely, we always write the basis vectors in a row, the component of \\(X\\) is written as a column vector, hence on the right. Consequently, a matrix with row index \\(i\\) and column index \\(j\\) is written as \\((A^i_j)_{1\\le i,j\\le n}\\).\nSimilarly, for a co-vector field \\(\\balpha\\in \\Gamma(T^*M)\\), it can be written as: \\[\n    \\balpha=\\alpha_{\\red \\alpha}\\bomega^{\\red \\alpha}.\n\\tag{2.3}\\]",

    "text": "2.2 Tensors and Tensor Fields\nTo begin with, we recall the definition of a tensor for a vector space. Subsequently, tensor fields emerge as a natural extension of this concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition\n\n\n\nLet \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) be two real vector spaces of dimension \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), respectively.

For \\(\\bv\\in V, \\bw\\in W\\) and \\(\\balpha\\in V^*, \\bbeta\\in W^*\\), we define \\[\n    \\bv\\otimes \\bw(\\balpha, \\bbeta)=\\bv(\\balpha)\\bw(\\bbeta)\\in \\RR.\n\\] elements in \\(V\\otimes W\\) are called tensors. Let \\(\\{\\be_i\\}_{1\\le i\\le n}\\) (resp. \\(\\{\\bff_j\\}_{1\\le j\\le m}\\)) be a basis of \\(V\\) (resp. \\(W\\)), then \\(V\\otimes W\\) has a basis \\[\n    \\{\\be_i\\otimes \\bff_j\\}_{1\\le i\\le n, 1\\le j\\le m}.\n\\] Therefore \\(\\dim(V\\otimes W)=nm\\). Let \\(V\\) be a vector space, one can define tensors of type \\((r, s)\\) to be an element in the vector space: \\[\n    \\fT^r_s:=\\underbrace{V\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V}_{r\\ {\\text{terms}}}\\otimes \\underbrace{V^*\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes V^*}_{s\\ {\\text{terms}}}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample\n\n\n\n\nLet \\(V\\) be a vector space, and \\(v\\in V\\) be a vector.

In fact let \\(\\{\\be_i\\}_{1\\le i\\le n}\\) be a basis of \\(V\\) and \\(\\{\\bomega^j\\}_{1\\le j\\le n}\\) be the dual basis of \\(V^*\\).

Therefore \\[\n\\bT=a_i^\\alpha \\be_{\\alpha}\\otimes \\bomega^i.\n\\]\n\nTo calculate \\(\\bT(v)\\) for \\(\\bv=\\be_{\\alpha}v^{\\alpha}\\): \\[\n    \\bT(\\bv)=a_i^{\\beta} \\delta_{\\alpha}^i \\be_{\\beta} \\cdot v^{\\alpha} = \\be_{\\beta}(a_{\\alpha}^{\\beta} v^{\\alpha}) ,\n\\] the right hand side is matrices multiplication.\n\nLet \\(\\Phi: V\\times V \\to \\RR\\) be a bilinear form, it can be viewed as a \\((0, 2)\\)-tensor. Let \\(\\{\\be_i\\}_{1\\le i\\le n}\\) be as above.

We have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition\n\n\n\nLet \\(M\\) be a smooth manifold. A tensor field \\(\\bT\\) of type \\((r, s)\\) on \\(M\\) is a smooth section of the bundle \\[\n    \\fT(M)^r_s:=\\underbrace{TM\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes TM}_{r\\ {\\text{terms}}}\\otimes \\underbrace{T^*M\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes T^*M}_{s\\ {\\text{terms}}}.\n\\] It can also be viewed as a pointwisely multilinear function: \\[\n    \\bT: \\underbrace{T^*M\\times \\cdots \\times T^*M}_{r\\ {\\text{terms}}}\\times \\underbrace{TM\\times \\cdots \\times TM}_{s\\ {\\text{terms}}} \\to \\RR.\n\\]\n\n\nFeeding a co-vector field to a vector field \\(X\\) , which is a \\((1, 0)\\)-tensor field, produces a function on \\(M\\). Similarly, feeding a vector field to a co-vector field \\(\\balpha\\), which is a \\((0, 1)\\)-tensor field, also produces a function.\nIn a local frame, a tensor \\(\\bT\\) can be written as \\[\n    \\bT=T^{j_1, \\cdots, j_r}_{i_1, \\cdots, i_s}\\be_{j_1}\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\be_{j_r}\\otimes \\bomega^{i_1}\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\bomega^{i_s},\n\\] where the coefficient is given by: \\[\n    \\bT^{j_1, \\cdots, j_r}_{i_1, \\cdots, i_s}:=T(\\bomega^{j_1},\\cdots, \\bomega^{j_r}, \\be_{i_1}, \\cdots, \\be_{i_s}).\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRemark\n\n\n\nA tensor can be denoted by either the symbol \\(\\bT\\) or its coefficients \\(T^{j_1, \\cdots, j_r}_{i_1, \\cdots, i_s}\\). The first method is concise and readily readily identifies the tensor as “T”, but without revealing its type. The second method is more verbose but offers the benefit of revealing both the name and type \\((r, s)\\) of the tensor.\nHowever, caution is necessary. A specific coefficient of a tensor itself carries no geometric meaning. Its value depends on the chosen local coordinate chart or frame. Therefore, when encountering a single coefficient like \\(T^i_j\\)​, it typically refers to the entire tensor, not just that specific coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition\n\n\n\nThe set of all tensor fields of type \\((r, s)\\) on \\(M\\) is denoted by \\(\\cT^r_s\\) and the set of all tensor fields is denoted by \\[\n    \\cT:=\\bigoplus_{r, s\\ge 0}\\cT^r_s.\n\\] For a \\((r,s)\\) tensor \\(\\bT\\) and a \\((p, q)\\) tensor \\(\\bS\\), for \\(i=1, 2\\), then we define \\(\\bT\\otimes \\bS\\) by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    (\\bT\\otimes\\bS)&(\\alpha_1, \\cdots,\\alpha_r,\\cdots, \\alpha_{r+p}, X_1, \\cdots, X_s,\\cdots, X_{s+q} )\\\\\n    &=\\bT(\\alpha_1, \\cdots, \\alpha_r, X_1, \\cdots, X_s)\\bS(\\alpha_{r+1},\\cdots, \\alpha_{r+p}, X_{s+1}, \\cdots, X_{s+q}),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] For \\(\\alpha_i\\in T^*M, X\\in TM\\). One can define the contraction of the \\(k\\)-th contravariant index and the \\(l\\)-th covariant index: \\[\n    \\Cont=\\Cont^k_l: \\cT^r_s\\to \\cT^{r-1}_{s-1},\n\\] by \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    &\\Cont^k_l(\\be_{j_1}\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\be_{j_r}\\otimes \\bomega^{i_1}\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\bomega^{i_s})\\\\\n    &=\\bomega^{i_l}(\\be_{j_k})\\be_{j_1}\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\hat{\\be}_{j_k}\\otimes\\cdots  \\otimes\\be_{j_r}\\otimes \\bomega^{i_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes \\hat{\\bomega}^{i_l} \\otimes\\cdots\\otimes \\bomega^{i_s}\\\\\n    &=\\delta_{j_k}^{i_l}\\be_{j_1}\\otimes\\cdots \\otimes \\hat{\\be}_{j_k}\\otimes\\cdots  \\otimes\\be_{j_r}\\otimes \\bomega^{i_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes \\hat{\\bomega}^{i_l} \\otimes\\cdots\\otimes \\bomega^{i_s},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] where the terms with hats are omitted. It can be checked that \\(\\Cont^k_l\\) is independent of the choice of basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExercise\n\n\n\nProve that for \\(\\bT\\in\\cT^r_s\\). The coefficients of the contracted tensor \\(\\Cont^k_l(\\bT)\\in \\cT^{r-1}_{s-1}\\) are given by:\n\\[\n(\\Cont^k_l(\\bT))^{i_1, \\cdots, i_{r-1}}_{j_1, \\cdots, j_{s-1}}=T^{i_1, \\cdots, i_{k-1}, \\red{m}, i_{k}, \\cdots, i_{r-1}}_{j_1, \\cdots, j_{l-1}, \\red{m}, j_l, \\cdots,  j_{s-1}}\n\\]\n(TikZ diagram omitted for web compatibility)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample\n\n\n\nLet \\(V\\) be an \\(n\\)-dimensional real vector space. Let \\(\\bT\\) be a linear map from \\(V\\) to \\(V\\), i.e. a \\((1, 1)\\) tensor and can be written as \\[\n    \\bT=T^{\\beta}_{\\alpha}\\be_{\\beta}\\otimes \\be^{\\alpha}.\n\\] We can apply the contraction operator \\(\\Cont\\) to \\(\\bT\\), since there is only one possible way of contracting the upper and lower indices. Clearly \\(\\Cont(\\bT)\\in \\cT^0_0=\\RR\\), we have \\[\n    \\Tr(\\bT)=\\Cont(\\bT)=T^{\\alpha}_{\\alpha},\n\\] remember that we need to sum over the repeated index \\(\\alpha\\). Therefore \\(\\Cont(\\bT)\\) is a number. This is simply calculating the trace of the square matrix \\((T^j_i)\\) in linear algebra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRemark\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\bT\\) be a linear map from \\(V\\) to \\(V\\), then \\(\\bT\\) is a \\((1, 1)\\)-tensor. Its dual map \\(\\bT^*: V^*\\to V^*\\) is also a \\((1, 1)\\) tensor. What’s the difference between these two tensors? Let \\(\\{\\be_1, \\cdots, \\be_n\\}\\) be a basis of \\(V\\) and \\(\\{\\bomega^1, \\cdots, \\bomega^n\\}\\) be the dual basis. We write \\[\n    \\bT=T^{\\alpha}_{\\beta} \\be_{\\alpha}\\otimes \\bomega^{\\beta}.\n\\] In linear algebra, if we fix a basis and its dual basis, the matrix representation of the dual map coincides with the transpose of the original map, i.e. \\((T^*)^i_j=T^j_i\\). We have \\[\n    \\bT^*=T^{\\beta}_{\\alpha} \\bomega^{\\alpha}\\otimes \\be_{\\beta},\n\\] Note that we intensionally swap the order of \\(\\be_{\\alpha}\\otimes \\bomega^{\\beta}\\) to \\(\\bomega^{\\alpha}\\otimes \\be_{\\beta}\\), reflecting the convention: \\[\n    \\bT\\in \\Gamma(TM\\otimes T^*M), \\ \\bT^*\\in \\Gamma(T^*M\\otimes TM).\n\\] It can be very useful if we arrange the super- and sub-scripts in a linear order from left to right. For example, if \\(T\\in \\Gamma(TM\\otimes T^*M\\otimes TM\\otimes TM)\\), then its component will be written as: \\[\n    T^{\\lightgray{\\circ} j\\lightgray{\\circ}\\lightgray{\\circ}}_{i\\lightgray{\\circ}kl}=T^{\\ j}_{i\\ k l}\n\\] Using this new convention, we have \\[\n    \\bT=T^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta} \\be_{\\alpha}\\otimes \\bomega^{\\beta}\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\bT^*=T^{\\ \\beta}_{\\alpha} \\bomega^{\\alpha}\\otimes \\be_{\\beta}\n\\]",

Suppose \\[\n    (x^1, \\cdots, x^n): U\\to \\RR^n,\n\\] and \\[\n    (x^{1'}, \\cdots, x^{n'}): U'\\to \\RR^n,\n\\] are two open coordinate charts with \\(U\\cap U' \\ne \\varnothing\\). Let \\[\n    \\be_i:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\quad \\be_{i'}:=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i'}}\n\\] be two bases of \\(\\Gamma(TM)\\) restricted on \\(U\\cap U'\\). Suppose the change of bases matrix \\((L^i_{\\ j}): U\\cap U' \\to \\GL(n, \\RR)\\) is given by: \\[\n    \\be_{j'}=\\be_{\\alpha} L^{\\alpha}_{\\ j'}.\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nBy the chain rule in calculus we have \\[\n    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j'}}=\\frac{\\partial x^{\\alpha}}{\\partial x^{j'}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\alpha}}.\n\\] Therefore \\[\n    L^i_{\\ j'}=\\frac{\\partial x^i}{\\partial x^{j'}}.\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nDenote the inverse matrix of \\(\\{L^i_{\\ j'}\\}\\) by \\(\\{L^{i'}_{\\ j}\\}\\), i.e. \\[\n    L^i_{\\ \\beta'}L^{\\beta'}_{\\ \\ j}=\\delta^i_{\\ j} \\quad L^{i'}_{\\ \\beta}L^{\\beta}_{\\ \\ j'}=\\delta^{i'}_{\\ j'}\n\\] By Equation 2.5, we have \\[\n    L^{i'}_{\\ j}=\\frac{\\partial x^{i'}}{\\partial x^{j}}.\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\n\n2.4.1 How vector fields changes?\nLet \\(X\\) be a vector field. On the overlap \\(U\\cap U'\\), one can expand it in the first bases: \\[\n    X=\\be_{\\alpha}u^{\\alpha}.\n\\] On the other hand we have: \\[\n    X=\\be_{\\beta'} u^{\\beta'} =(\\be_{\\alpha} L^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta'})u^{\\beta'}.\n\\] It follows that \\[\n    u^{\\alpha}=L^{\\alpha}_{\\ \\beta'}u^{\\beta'}\\Longleftrightarrow u^{\\beta'}=L^{\\beta'}_{\\ \\alpha}u^{\\alpha}\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nThis is well known in linear algebra: the components of a vector must transformed, as in Equation 2.7, inversely as the bases transformed in Equation 2.4.\n\n\n2.4.2 How one forms changes?\nIf \\(\\{\\bomega^i\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\bomega^{j'}\\}\\) denote the dual basis on \\(U\\) and \\(U'\\) respectively. Then under the change of bases Equation 2.4, we have \\[\n    \\bomega^{i'}=L^{i'}_{\\ \\beta}\\bomega^{\\beta}.\n\\] The components of the one-form \\(\\bsigma=\\sigma_{\\alpha}\\bomega^{\\alpha}=\\sigma_{\\beta'}\\bomega^{\\beta'}\\) satisfy: \\[\n    \\sigma_{i'}=\\sigma_{\\beta}L^{\\beta}_{\\ i'}\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\n\n\n2.4.3 General tensors\nFor a tensor of type \\((r, s)\\), its behavior under change of coordinates is a combination of the previous two types. For example: \\[\n    T^{k'}_{\\ i'j'}= T^a_{\\ bc}L^{k'}_{\\ a}L^b_{\\ i'}L^c_{\\ j'}.\n\\] Now you can derive the general formula for the changes of more complicated tensors. Sometimes the formula can be used to check whether an expression with many super- and sub-scripts is a tensor or not.",
